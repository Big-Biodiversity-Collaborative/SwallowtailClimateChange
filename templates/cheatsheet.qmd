**Predicted areas of suitability for two _Papilio_ species.** Areas 
predicted to be suitable for _P. cresphontes_  and _P. rumiko_ under current 
climate conditions (a, b) and under the SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s (c, d). The 
changes in suitability between current conditions and SSP3-7.0 in the 2050s are 
shown in (e) and (f).

**Predicted changes in suitable area under the SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s.** 
The change in total suitable area, which includes currently unsuitable areas, 
in 1,000 km^2, the percentage of currently suitable area retained in the 
SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s, and the total percentage change in suitable area 
under the SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s.

**Predicted changes in distribution under the SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s.** 
Longitudinal (a) and latitudinal (b) changes in margins of suitable area (_this 
could be better defined_) between current climate and forecast climate for the 
2050s under the SSP3-7.0 model.

**Species richness and richness hotspots of North American _Papilio_ species.** 
Total species richness of areas predicted to be suitable for _Papilio_ species 
under current climate conditions (a) and the SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s (c). 
Areas designated as richness hotspots for current (b) and the 2050s under 
SSP3-7.0 (d). The change in species richness between current conditions and the 
2050s is shown in (e) and the change in areas designated as richness hotspots 
is shown in (f).

**Species richness hotspots area changes under SSP3-7.0 model.**
Total area suitable for at least four species of North American _Papilio_ shown 
in (a). Total area (b) and percent area (c) of richness hotspots that occur on 
lands currently protected under one of four management categories.

::: {#fig-s-shift-south fig-pos="H"}

![](../output/manuscript/shifts/shift-south.png)

**Shifts in southern edge of predicted suitable areas.** Change in kilometers 
(relative to contemporary predictions) in the median southern latitude of areas 
predicted as suitable for each *Papilio* species and at least one host plant 
species under three SSPs and two time points. Points above the horizontal 
dashed line indicate range contractions northward and points below the 
horizontal dashed line indicate range expansions southward.

**Shifts in northern edge of predicted suitable areas.** Change in kilometers 
(relative to contemporary predictions) in the median northern latitude of areas 
predicted as suitable for each *Papilio* species and at least one host plant 
species under three SSPs and two time points. Points above the horizontal

**Shifts in western edge of predicted suitable areas.** Change in kilometers 
(relative to contemporary predictions) in the median western longitude of areas 
predicted as suitable for each *Papilio* species and at least one host plant 
species under three SSPs and two time points. Points left of the horizontal 
dashed line indicate range expansions westward and points right of the 
horizontal dashed line indicate range contractions eastward.

predicted as suitable for each *Papilio* species and at least one host plant 
species under three SSPs and two time points. Points left of the horizontal 
dashed line indicate range contractions westward and points right of the 
horizontal dashed line indicate range expansions eastward.

## Figure S5? (richness change) **TODO**

This figure isn't made. It would be like panel e of the main manuscript 
richness figure, shown below:

**Illustration purposes only**. See panel e and note above figure.
