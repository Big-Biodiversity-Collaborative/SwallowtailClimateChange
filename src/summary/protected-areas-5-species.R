# For each species, want to know 
#    + how much currently suitable area is in protected
#    + how much forecast suitable area is in protected

# Across all species, is the amount current suitable & protected significantly 
# different than forecast suitable & protected

# Read in species list

# Read in climate model info

# Read in protected habitat info

# Create data frame to hold information on amount protected/not protected
# Species | climate | amount suitable & protected | amount suitable & not protected

# Create list (?) to hold statistical results (one element per forecast model?)

# Iterate over species

# Read in current suitable

# Calculate amount suitable & protected/unprotected

# Iterate over forecast climate

# Read in forecast suitable

# Calculate amount suitable & protected/unprotected

# Run comparison to current (t-test?)

# End iterating over forecast climate

# End iterating over species

# Do some sort of visualization?
