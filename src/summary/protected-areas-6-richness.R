# Want to know average richness in protected vs. unprotected areas (maybe not?)
#    TODO: For the above, may need to decide which areas to look at - all of 
#          North America?
# Want to compare richness in protected areas in current vs. future climates

# Read in protected areas info

# Read in current richness raster

# Create data frame to hold info for each climate model

# Create list (?) to hold statistical analysis results

# Calculate average richness in protected areas

# Iterate over forecast climate models

# Read in forecast richness raster

# Calculate average richness in protected areas

# TODO: Is there a way to do cell-by-cell comparison, as protected areas are 
# not changing between current and forecast? Seems like this would be 
# especially appropriate for a paired t-test

# Do t-test (or other?) to compare current vs forecast richness

# End iterating over all forecast climate models
