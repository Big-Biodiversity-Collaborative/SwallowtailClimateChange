# Scripts for downloading and checking data

These scripts download data, perform pre-analysis processing, and run some 
minor quality assessment on the downloads. The downloads include:

+ Observational data from [GBIF](https://gbif.org/) for both insect and plant
species
+ Contemporary climate data for 2000-2018; monthly data for minimum 
temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation are downloaded and used to 
generate averages for the 19 bioclimatic variables.
+ (PENDING) Forecast climate data from two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP)
based on [ensemble projections](https://adaptwest.databasin.org/pages/adaptwest-climatena/).
