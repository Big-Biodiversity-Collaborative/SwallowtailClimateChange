::: {#fig-distributions}

![](../../output/manuscript/Figure-Distributions.png)

**Predicted areas of suitability for two _Papilio_ species.** Areas 
predicted to be suitable for _P. cresphontes_  and _P. rumiko_ under current 
climate conditions (a, b) and under the SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s (c, d). The 
changes in suitability between current conditions and SSP3-7.0 in the 2050s are 
shown in (e) and (f).

Supplemental Table 1. Total suitable area and suitable area overlapping the 
suitable area for at least one host plant species for `r nrow(area_overlap)` 
species of _Papilio_ under current climate conditions.

::: {#fig-shifts}

![](../../output/manuscript/Figure-Shifts.png)

**Predicted changes in distribution under the SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s.** 
Longitudinal (a) and latitudinal (b) changes in margins of suitable area (_this 
could be better defined_) between current climate and forecast climate for the 
2050s under the SSP3-7.0 model.
:::

::: {fig-richness}

![](../../output/manuscript/Figure-Richness.png)

**Species richness and richness hotspots of North American _Papilio_ species.** 
Total species richness of areas predicted to be suitable for _Papilio_ species 
under current climate conditions (a) and the SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s (c). 
Areas designated as richness hotspots for current (b) and the 2050s under 
SSP3-7.0 (d). The change in species richness between the two timepoint is shown 
in (e).
:::

::: {fig-protected}

![](../../output/manuscript/Figure-Protected.png)

**Species richness hotspots area changes under SSP3-7.0 model climate conditions.**
Total area suitable for at least four species of North American _Papilio_ shown 
in (a). Total area (b) and percent area (c) of richness hotspots that occur on 
lands currently protected under one of four management categories.
