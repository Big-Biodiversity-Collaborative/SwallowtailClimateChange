::: {#fig-distributions}

![](../../output/manuscript/Figure-Distributions.png)

**Predicted areas of suitability for two _Papilio_ species.** Areas 
predicted to be suitable for _P. cresphontes_  and _P. rumiko_ under current 
climate conditions (a, b) and under the SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s (c, d). The 
changes in suitability between current conditions and SSP3-7.0 in the 2050s are 
shown in (e) and (f).

Supplemental Table 1. Total suitable area and suitable area overlapping the 
suitable area for at least one host plant species for `r nrow(area_overlap)` 
species of _Papilio_ under current climate conditions.

::: {#fig-shifts}

![](../../output/manuscript/Figure-Shifts.png)

**Predicted changes in distribution under the SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s.** 
Longitudinal (a) and latitudinal (b) changes in margins of suitable area (_this 
could be better defined_) between current climate and forecast climate for the 
2050s under the SSP3-7.0 model.
:::

::: {fig-richness}

![](../../output/manuscript/Figure-Richness.png)

**Species richness and richness hotspots of North American _Papilio_ species.** 
Total species richness of areas predicted to be suitable for _Papilio_ species 
under current climate conditions (a) and the SSP3-7.0 model in the 2050s (c). 
Areas designated as richness hotspots for current (b) and the 2050s under 
SSP3-7.0 (d). The change in species richness between the two timepoint is shown 
in (e).
:::

::: {fig-protected}

![](../../output/manuscript/Figure-Protected.png)

**Species richness hotspots area changes under SSP3-7.0 model climate conditions.**
Total area suitable for at least four species of North American _Papilio_ shown 
in (a). Total area (b) and percent area (c) of richness hotspots that occur on 
lands currently protected under one of four management categories.

**Shifts in southern edge of predicted suitable areas.** Change in kilometers 
(relative to contemporary predictions) in the median southern latitude of areas 
predicted as suitable for each *Papilio* species and at least one host plant 
species under three SSPs and two time points.

species under three SSPs and two time points.

species under three SSPs and two time points.
