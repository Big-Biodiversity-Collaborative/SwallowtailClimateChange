# bash scripts for creating individual species analysis files

The approach of creating scripts for individual species is largely 
**DEPRECATED**; it has been replaced by parallel processing approach in 
src/run-indiv.

These bash scripts create R analysis scripts for individual species. The R 
scripts are based on templates in the templates directory; the resultant R 
scripts are saved in scr/indiv (and are not likely under version control).
